The construction industry has a significant impact on the environment. From deforestation and resource waste to energy consumption and carbon emissions, traditional construction practices have directly affected our planet.

However, change is underway, and **Cheaper Buy** is at the forefront of this transformation, leading the way with its commitment to sustainable wood and environmental responsibility.

## 🌿 The Environmental Challenge

The numbers speak for themselves:  
- The construction industry accounts for **36% of global energy consumption** and **40% of CO₂ emissions**.  
- 30% of materials used in construction come from non-renewable resources.  
- More than 40% of solid waste comes from construction processes.
