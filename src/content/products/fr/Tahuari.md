    Tahuari wood is one of the most resistant and durable tropical species available on the market. Its color ranges from pale yellow to golden brown, darkening over time. It is highly valued in construction and carpentry due to its resistance to moisture, insects, and fungi. Its density and hardness make it ideal for high-traffic applications and structural use.
