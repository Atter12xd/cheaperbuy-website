    Cumala wood is one of the most widely used species in the timber industry due to its lightness, versatility, and ease of work. It is a medium-density wood with a color range from pale yellow to light brown, making it ideal for decorative and structural applications. Its fine and uniform texture allows for high-quality finishes with varnishes and lacquers.
