    Estoraque wood, also known as Estoraquel, is a tropical species valued for its hardness, durability, and distinctive aroma. Its color ranges from dark brown to reddish, with fine veins that give it an aesthetically appealing appearance. It is a dense and heavy wood with high resistance to moisture and pest attacks, making it an excellent choice for high-wear applications.
